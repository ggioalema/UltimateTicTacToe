# Tic-Tac-Toe / Trissone (Ultimate Tic Tac Toe)

This project provides two implementations of **Tic-Tac-Toe** and its extended version **Trissone** (also known as *Ultimate Tic Tac Toe*):

- **Interactive mode** (`Interactive.py`): play against another human using a graphical interface built with `pygame`.
- **Simulation mode** (`Trissone.py`): run automatic simulations of many games and visualize results/statistics using `matplotlib`.

---

## Project Structure

- `Interactive.py` — main interactive game loop with `pygame` (classic Tic-Tac-Toe and Trissone mode).
- `Trissone.py` — core game logic, classes (`Tris`, `Trissone`), and simulation utilities with visualization.
- `main.py` — entry point for running simulations via `Trissone`.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pygame numpy matplotlib
```
